#summary STC defs

= Introduction =

These blocks works like some sort of headers for sequences, referencing [SD Sequence Data] blocks and some other stuff.

Seems there can be more than one [STC] block per sequence if there are several versions of an animation sequence. [STG] represents an [STC] lookup table for each [SEQS] entry.
Example: Cover Full, Cover Shield

Bones, among other structures, reference the [SD Sequence Data] located in these structs for animation.

== Sequence Data Information ==
Translation and Scaling animation data use the same [SD Sequence Data] entry, SD3V which uses [SD#VEC3 VEC3]'s for keyframes. [SD#EVNT EVNT] animations determine the end of an animation sequence. Sequences that are part of a looped series require 'Evt_SeqEnd' [SD#EVNT EVNT] keyframes so that they only loop once in the sequence. Examples of these animations are Stand animations, which typically all loop, but each only plays once in the loop and are picked based on their frequency setting of their corresponding SEQS entry.
