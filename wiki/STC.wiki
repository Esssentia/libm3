#summary STC defs

= Introduction =

These blocks works like some sort of headers for sequences, referencing [SD] blocks and some other stuff.

Seems there can be more than one [STC] block per sequence if there are several versions of an animation sequence.
Example: Cover Full, Cover Shield

Bones reference the sequence data located in these structs for animation.

    /*0x10*/ Reference animid; //list of unique uint32s used in chunks with animation. The index of these correspond with the data in the next reference.

    /*0x84*/ Reference bnds;
