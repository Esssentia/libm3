#summary STC defs

= Introduction =

These blocks works like some sort of headers for sequences, referencing [SD] blocks and some other stuff.

Seems there can be more than one [STC] block per sequence if there are several versions of an animation sequence.
Example: Cover Full, Cover Shield

Bones reference the sequence data located in these structs for animation.

// Size = 140 byte / 0x8C byte

    /*0x00*/ Reference name;
    /*0x08*/ uint32 d1;
    /*0x0C*/ uint16 indSEQ[2]; //points to animation in SEQS chunk, twice for some reason
    /*0x10*/ Reference animid; //list of unique uint32s used in chunks with animation. The index of these correspond with the data in the next reference.
    /*0x18*/ Reference animindex; //lookup table, connects animid with it's animation data, nEntries of AnimationIndex reference using U32_ id
    /*0x20*/ uint32 d2;
    /*0x24*/ Reference SeqData[13]; //SD3V - Trans, SD4Q - Rotation, SDR3 - Scale?, SDFG - Flags, SDMB - Bounding Boxes?
